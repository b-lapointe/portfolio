            <p>
            I'm a recent and eager graduate from St. Francis Xavier University. I completed my time thereby receiving a bachelor of science degree with a major in computer science and a minor in studio art. I have been passionate about front-end software development ever since I completed my first COOP placement. I have found it to be the perfect blend of my major and minor and am hoping to soon start a career in this field!<br></br>
            <br></br>
            I’m originally from New Brunswick but have spent my last few years in Nova Scotia and am currently living here. When I’m not working on furthering my skills as a developer I can be found playing video games, making some digital art or binging a tv show with my kittens.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            If you’d like to work with me, I’d love to hear from you!
